# Identity v2 — Design RFC

**Status:** DRAFT (Phase 0 of EPIC #301)
**Author:** Claude (co-architect with Ritual North)
**Date opened:** 2026-05-24
**Target completion:** end of week
**Implementation tracker:** Tasks #303–#312

---

## Motivation

WattPost today has three independent authentication mechanisms wired
in parallel, none of which compose cleanly:

1. **LAN password** — first-boot generated, single shared credential
   per appliance. Read-only-public bypass means anyone on the LAN
   can browse Settings without it. (Concretely surfaced in Ritual North's
   conversation on 2026-05-24: "I went to the settings page and it
   didn't ask me to login.")
2. **Cloud account password + TOTP** — separate identity, separate
   realm, no relationship to the LAN credential.
3. **HMAC broker auth** — cloud signs every proxied request with a
   per-appliance `sso_secret`. Compromise of the cloud = compromise
   of every paired appliance, with no countersignature path.

Three parallel mechanisms means:

- **UX confusion** for any user who uses both cloud and LAN paths
  (two passwords, no SSO carry-over between them).
- **Security ceiling** at the weakest mechanism. Cloud account
  compromise grants full appliance control because the cloud is the
  sole authority on broker auth. There is no per-appliance counter-
  signature to bound the blast radius.
- **No room to grow** into the multi-tenancy + RBAC + audit story
  the enterprise / building-automation target customer requires
  (see memory `project_enterprise_ambition`).

Identity v2 replaces all three with one cryptographically-coherent
identity layer modelled on Home Assistant Cloud SSO, UniFi cloud
SSO, and standard OIDC patterns.

---

## Goals

1. **One identity per user.** Cloud account is the canonical
   identity. LAN access SSO's against it via OIDC redirect.
   Local-only customers (off-grid, never paired) get a local-only
   identity equivalent in shape.
2. **One credential per device pairing.** ed25519 keypair generated
   on the appliance at pair time. Public key cloud-side, private
   key never leaves the appliance. Replaces the shared-secret
   `sso_secret` model.
3. **One token format.** Short-lived JWT with explicit scopes,
   issued by an OIDC server in the cloud. Same token verified the
   same way across dashboard, broker, kiosk, command queue.
4. **Cloud compromise has a hard ceiling.** Without the per-device
   private key, a compromised cloud cannot forge new commands —
   only relay ones the appliance has already signed. Destructive
   commands require a fresh user re-auth on top.
5. **Offline-first still works.** Appliance functions for N days
   without cloud reachability via a pre-cached refresh token; an
   explicit local-emergency credential is the floor.
6. **Standards-compliant.** OIDC + WebAuthn + mTLS + JWT — all
   primitives an auditor can recognise. No bespoke crypto, no
   home-rolled token format.
7. **SOC2-evidence-ready.** Audit log entries cryptographically
   signed by both appliance and cloud, hash-chained for tamper
   detection.

## Non-goals

- Backwards compatibility forever. We'll support v1 auth alongside
  v2 for one release cycle, then drop v1 entirely. No long-tail
  legacy code.
- Hardware-backed key storage *required* in v2 (#312 is optional
  Phase 10). Software-encrypted private key on disk is the
  v2 baseline; HSM/secure-element is an enterprise upgrade.
- Federation with external IdPs (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD) — desirable
  long-term but out of scope for v2. The OIDC layer we build is the
  *foundation* that enables this later.

## Personas to satisfy

| Persona | Primary access path | What they expect |
|---|---|---|
| **Off-grid LAN-only** | `http://192.168.1.50/` on LAN | One login on each device, never asked again. No cloud account required. Works fully offline. |
| **Cloud customer on LAN** | `http://192.168.1.50/` on LAN | One identity (their cloud account). No second password. Passkey or TOTP. |
| **Cloud customer remote** | `https://<slug>.wattpost.cloud` | Same identity, no extra step. Works anywhere. |
| **Family member / shared display** | `?token=<JWT>` kiosk URL | No login at all, scoped read-only access. Owner controls expiry + revocation. |
| **Installer (multi-site)** | Same as cloud customer | Fleet-wide actions require re-auth. Audit log records every action. |
| **Building-automation operator** (future) | Cloud + role-based delegation | Site engineer can see + manage their building's sites only. CIO sees all. Audit log shows who did what. |

## Architecture overview

### Trust roots

| Key | Generated where | Lives where | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloud signing key** (ed25519) | Cloud, at first cloud deploy | Cloud KMS / sealed file (rotated quarterly) | Signing JWTs the appliance verifies |
| **Cloud TLS cert** | Let's Encrypt | Cloud (CF Tunnel terminates) | Standard HTTPS |
| **Cloud client-cert CA** (Phase 6) | Cloud, at deploy | Cloud (offline root + active intermediate) | Issuing appliance client certs for mTLS heartbeat |
| **Appliance keypair** (ed25519) | Appliance, at pair time | Appliance disk (libsodium sealed-box, key from machine-id+entropy) | Signing commands the cloud verifies, signing audit log entries |
| **Appliance client cert** (Phase 6) | Issued by cloud CA at pair time | Appliance disk (alongside keypair) | mTLS heartbeat auth |
| **User WebAuthn credentials** | User device | User device (TPM/secure-enclave) | Primary user authentication |
| **User TOTP secret** | Cloud, on user opt-in | Cloud (encrypted at rest) | 2FA fallback when WebAuthn unavailable |
| **Backup encryption key** (#300) | Appliance, at pair time | Appliance disk + offered to user as recovery phrase | Encrypting cloud-stored backups |
| **JWT signing key (kiosk-local)** | Appliance, at first kiosk-token mint | Appliance disk | Signing JWTs for LAN-only kiosk URLs |

### JWT shape

```json
{
  "iss": "https://wattpost.cloud",         // cloud-issued
                                            // or "https://<slug>.wattpost.cloud" for appliance-issued kiosk tokens
  "sub": "user_42",                         // cloud account id, or "kiosk_<uuid>" for kiosk tokens
  "aud": "appliance_137",                   // specific appliance id this token works against
  "iat": 1716553200,
  "exp": 1716554100,                        // 15 min for user tokens, configurable for kiosk
  "jti": "01J5...",                         // ulid for revocation list
  "scope": "dashboard:read dashboard:write appliance:admin",
  "amr": ["webauthn"],                      // authentication methods used; "totp", "password", "kiosk-token"
  "acr": "high",                            // assurance level: "high" (fresh webauthn), "med" (totp), "low" (long-cookie), "kiosk"
  "wp_appliance_kid": "ed25519:<fingerprint>"  // public-key fingerprint of the appliance this token was issued for
}
```

Signed by the cloud's ed25519 key, verified by appliance against
cached cloud public key.

### Scopes

```
dashboard:read              — view tiles, devices, history, energy
dashboard:write             — change rules, add/edit devices, settings
kiosk:read                  — narrow read-only subset for shared displays
appliance:admin             — pairing, unpair, update, restore, disk_cleanup
appliance:command:destructive  — destructive subset (restore, fleet update, delete site, billing)
                                 requires acr=high
billing:read
billing:write
account:read
account:write               — change password, manage 2FA, manage WebAuthn keys
fleet:read                  — multi-site view for installer / building-operator
fleet:write                 — bulk operations across sites
admin:tenant                — tenant admin (RBAC, user invites)
admin:platform              — WattPost staff only
```

Destructive operations check both scope AND `acr` claim — a long-
lived "remember me" session has scope=dashboard:write but acr=low,
so it can't trigger restore without a re-auth bump to acr=high.

Key properties:
- **No long-lived shared secret is ever transmitted.** The appliance
  generates its private key locally; only the public key crosses the
  wire.
- **Pairing code is short-lived (2 min) and single-use.** Bound to
  the user that minted it.
- **Cloud's public key (JWKS) is fetched at pair time and cached
  forever** (with rotation handled via JWKS endpoint kid header).
- **Refresh token is the only credential the appliance holds for
  the cloud account** — short-lived; rotated on each use. Cloud-side
  revocable.

```

Key properties:
- **User logs in once on the cloud** (passkey or TOTP). No separate
  LAN password.
- **Appliance does NOT call the cloud during the cookie's lifetime**
  — JWT signature verification is offline using the cached JWKS.
- **Refresh happens silently** when JWT expires (browser still has
  cloud session cookie via cloud's domain).
- **If cloud is unreachable**, the LAN session cookie is still
  valid for its full lifetime. Login fails new sessions but
  existing ones keep working until cookie expiry. After that,
  fall through to offline mode (Phase 4).

Key properties:
- **Destructive commands carry the cloud JWT *and* a hash of the
  payload.** Cloud can't queue a "restore" that points at a
  different backup file after the fact.
- **Appliance verifies the JWT before acting.** Compromised cloud
  needs the cloud's private key to mint a destructive-scope JWT;
  if the cloud is breached, key rotation invalidates outstanding
  tokens immediately.
- **Re-auth window is 5 min.** Subsequent destructive actions in
  the same flow don't re-prompt; first one after 5 min does.

### Offline mode

When the appliance can't reach the cloud:

1. **Existing local sessions keep working** until their cookie
   expires (default 90 days, configurable).
2. **New LAN logins** attempt the OIDC redirect, fail (no cloud
   reachable), and fall through to the **emergency local login**.
3. **Emergency local credentials** are set during pairing OR by the
   user explicitly in Settings. Username + password, rate-limited,
   audit-logged. Intended as the floor — "the internet is down and
   I need to look at my dashboard".
4. **Destructive commands cannot be triggered offline.** They
   require a fresh cloud auth (acr=high), which is impossible
   without the cloud. This is intentional — the only time you
   should be running a restore is when you have full faith in the
   auth chain.
5. **Local-only appliances (never paired)** use emergency local
   credentials as their primary auth. No OIDC dance — login form
   posts straight to local password verification. This is the
   off-grid customer who never wanted the cloud.

### Kiosk shares (unified)

All kiosk URLs are `?token=<JWT>`. The JWT has:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://wattpost.cloud" | "https://<slug>.wattpost.cloud",
  "sub": "kiosk_01J5...",
  "aud": "appliance_137",
  "scope": "kiosk:read",
  "exp": 1717158000,
  "acr": "kiosk",
  "wp_kiosk_label": "Living room display",
  "wp_kiosk_pin_ip": "10.0.0.42"           // optional first-IP pin
}
```

Cloud-issued kiosk JWTs (shared via `<slug>.wattpost.cloud/k/<token>`)
have `iss=cloud` and validate against the cloud's public key.
Appliance-issued kiosk JWTs (for local-only customers without a
cloud account) have `iss=<slug>.wattpost.cloud` and validate
against the appliance's own kiosk-signing key.

**Same JWT validation code path** — issuer determines which key to
verify against, scope determines what's allowed. No parallel
mechanisms.

---

## Open questions for design review

1. **Refresh token rotation cadence.** OIDC convention is rotate-
   on-use. Acceptable on a 5-min appliance heartbeat? Yes — trivial
   load.
2. **Cloud signing key rotation.** Quarterly via JWKS rollover.
   Verification side reads `kid` from JWT header and looks up the
   right key in the cached JWKS. Need to handle clock skew during
   rotation windows.
3. **Where do the keys actually live in cloud?** Litestar process
   has them in memory. Long-term: sealed-box on disk encrypted
   against a KMS key, KMS unlock at deploy time. Pre-launch: just
   encrypted on disk against a deploy-time env var.
4. **WebAuthn relying party ID.** Should be `wattpost.cloud` so
   passkeys work across subdomains (broker URLs are
   `<slug>.wattpost.cloud`).
5. **mTLS cert renewal.** Client certs at pair time, valid for 1y,
   appliance renews 30 days before expiry via standard ACME-ish
   flow over the existing heartbeat channel.
6. **JWT library.** `python-jose` is unmaintained as of 2024;
   `authlib` is the current safe pick. Cross-validate with `pyjwt`
   for verification only.
7. **Database schema migration.** New tables: `user_webauthn_credentials`,
   `appliance_keypairs`, `oidc_clients`, `oidc_authorization_codes`,
   `oidc_refresh_tokens`, `signed_audit_log`. Existing
   `appliances.sso_secret` and `bearer_token` columns deprecated
   but kept for one cycle for v1 fallback.
8. **Breaking-change inventory.** Every existing appliance must
   re-pair after v2 ships. Migration UX: cloud surfaces a "Pair
   v2" prompt on the site detail page, walks user through
   re-pairing (which is one tap on the appliance + entering a
   code, basically the same flow as today).

## Phasing (mapped to backlog tasks)

See EPIC #301 + sub-tasks #303–#312.

Phase 0 (this doc) blocks everything. Phase 1 (#303) is the
foundation everything else stands on. Phases 2 (#304) and 3 (#305)
together implement the SSO flow. Phase 4 (#306) handles offline.
Phase 5 (#307) and 6 (#308) are parallelisable. Phase 7 (#309)
unifies kiosks. Phase 8 (#310) wires audit signing. Phase 9 (#311)
adds re-auth gating. Phase 10 (#312) is optional hardware key
storage.

original /oidc/authorize url>`. After login, replay the authorize.

User-logged-in path: validate client_id + scope, mint code, 302 to
`<redirect_uri>?code=<code>&state=<state>`.

### Token

```
POST /oidc/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=<code>
&redirect_uri=<must match authorize>
&client_id=<client_id>
&code_verifier=<original PKCE verifier>
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "access_token": "<JWT>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "refresh_token": "<opaque>",
  "scope": "dashboard:write appliance:admin",
  "id_token": "<JWT — same claims minus scope>"
}
```

Refresh flow:
```
grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=<token>
&client_id=<client_id>
```

Refresh token rotation: response includes a new refresh token; old
one marked `rotated_to=<new>` and unusable.

### Userinfo

```
GET /oidc/userinfo
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

Returns minimal user profile (sub, email, name, tenant_id, roles).

### Revoke

```
POST /oidc/revoke
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

token=<token>
&token_type_hint=refresh_token|access_token
```

Token type access_token: add jti to revocation list. Token type
refresh_token: mark refresh row revoked.

### Re-auth bump

```
POST /reauth/webauthn
Authorization: Bearer <current_jwt>

{ "credential_response": {...WebAuthn AuthenticatorAssertionResponse...} }
```

Returns a new JWT with acr=high, exp=now+5min. Old JWT not revoked
but acr=high commands prefer the new one.

```
POST /reauth/totp
Authorization: Bearer <current_jwt>

{ "code": "123456" }
```

Same shape, TOTP path.

### Pairing extensions

```
POST /pair/code
Authorization: Bearer <cloud_session_jwt>

{ }
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "code": "ABC-XYZ",        // 6-7 char human-typeable
  "expires_at": "2026-05-24T12:35:00Z"
}
```

Code → {user_id, scope_grant} bound in `oidc_authorization_codes`
table with a special grant_type marker.

```
POST /pair/exchange
(no auth — code is the auth)

{ "code": "ABC-XYZ" }
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "appliance_id":         137,
  "appliance_label":      "Garage Stack",
  "cloud_jwks_url":       "https://wattpost.cloud/oidc/jwks",
  "oidc_client_id":       "apl_137_lan",
  "oidc_redirect_uri":    "http://__appliance__/auth/callback",
  "client_cert_csr_url":  "https://wattpost.cloud/pair/csr",
  "refresh_token":        "<opaque>",
  "tunnel_token":         "<CF tunnel cred>"
}
```

```
POST /pair/finalize
Authorization: Bearer <refresh_token from exchange>

{
  "public_key": "<base64 ed25519 pub>",
  "fingerprint": "<hex>"
}
```

Cloud stores public key in `appliance_keypairs`, returns OK. From
this point forward the appliance is fully paired.

## Migration plan from v1

The fleet of paired appliances today uses HMAC `sso_secret` +
bearer token. v2 is co-deployed with v1 for one release cycle so
no appliance is forced into a hard cut-over.

### Phase 1 ships in v0.2.0

- v2 cloud endpoints all live
- v2 appliance code path exists, gated by `identity_v2_enabled` on
  the appliances row (default FALSE)
- Existing v1 code paths untouched, all functionality continues
- Cloud UI surfaces a banner: **"Security upgrade available for N
  of your appliances"** → click → walks user through the upgrade

### Per-appliance upgrade flow

1. User clicks "Upgrade" on the cloud banner for appliance X.
2. Cloud calls a v1 command queue: `kind=upgrade_to_v2`.
3. Appliance picks up the command on next heartbeat (bearer-auth'd).
4. Appliance generates ed25519 keypair on-device.
5. Appliance POSTs `/api/internal/pair/upgrade-to-v2` to cloud with:
   - Old bearer token (v1 auth proves it's the same device)
   - New public key
   - Fingerprint
6. Cloud verifies bearer token matches `appliances.bearer_token`,
   stores public key in `appliance_keypairs`, flips
   `appliances.identity_v2_enabled = TRUE`, returns:
   - oidc_client_id
   - refresh_token (first v2 token, replaces bearer)
   - JWKS url
   - Client cert + key (if Phase 6 shipped)
7. Appliance writes its new keys to disk, deletes the old
   `bearer_token` config field.
8. Heartbeat from this appliance now uses v2 mechanism.
9. Cloud-side: `appliances.bearer_token` is kept but marked
   deprecated; appliance ignores it.

### Edge cases

- **Appliance offline at upgrade time.** Command queues; runs on
  next heartbeat. Banner stays on cloud UI until upgrade completes.
- **Upgrade fails mid-flight** (network blip during finalize).
  Appliance keypair on disk + v1 bearer still works. Cloud sees no
  v2 pairing; banner remains; user can retry. Idempotent.
- **Fleet upgrade.** Installer-tier user with N appliances clicks
  "Upgrade all" on the dashboard banner; commands queue for each;
  user sees per-appliance status. Same audit/safety chain as
  fleet update.
- **User can't upgrade** (e.g. local-only customer with no cloud
  account). They're already on v1 only; the upgrade banner doesn't
  show; they continue on v1 until v0.3.0 drops it. By v0.3.0 we'll
  have shipped a local-only-no-cloud upgrade path (set emergency
  password on the appliance, generate appliance-issued kiosk
  tokens, no cloud at all).

### Phase 2 ships in v0.3.0

- Drop v1 code paths entirely
- `appliances.sso_secret` + `bearer_token` columns dropped
- Any appliance that hasn't upgraded by this point is forced into
  a re-pair flow

## Threat model

### Attackers

| ID | Attacker | Capability | What they want |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1** | Internet randomer | Scans `*.wattpost.cloud`, public broker URLs | Any unauthenticated access |
| **T2** | Stolen cloud session | Phished or shoulder-surfed user, valid session cookie | Pivot to LAN, exfil data, persistent backdoor |
| **T3** | Compromised cloud server | Root on a wattpost.cloud VM (worst-case) | Mass exfil across all customers, install backdoors |
| **T4** | LAN attacker | On the customer's wifi (guest, neighbour, IoT pivot) | Device access, lateral movement |
| **T5** | Physical attacker | Pulls SD card or USB-sniffs the appliance | Extract secrets, persistent install |
| **T6** | Insider | WattPost staff with cloud admin access | Targeted data exfil, evidence tampering |
| **T7** | Supply chain | Compromised dep, GHCR account, npm package | Inject code into shipped releases |

### What v2 protects against

| Threat | Mitigation in v2 |
|---|---|
| T1 (internet) | TLS everywhere; 2FA / passkey on all login; rate limits (#156 extended in Phase 9); DDoS hardening (#145); no anonymous /healthz/deep leaks (#155) |
| T2 (stolen session) | acr=low for long cookies — can read dashboard but cannot trigger destructive ops without fresh re-auth (Phase 9). Restore is impossible without webauthn tap. Client-encrypted backups (#300) mean even if attacker downloads them they can't decrypt. |
| T3 (compromised cloud) | **The core architectural win.** Compromised cloud holds: cloud signing key (can mint JWTs), refresh tokens (can extend sessions). Does NOT hold: appliance private keys (can't forge appliance-signed audit entries; can't make appliance trust forged data on restore). Hash-chained audit log signed by appliances means tampering detectable. Backup encryption with appliance-held key means cloud can't decrypt or forge backups. |
| T4 (LAN attacker) | Strict-default auth (no anonymous GET). LAN access requires either OIDC SSO via cloud (so attacker needs the user's cloud creds) or the emergency local credential (rate limited, audit logged). No more browse-Settings-as-anon. |
| T5 (physical) | Software keys are sealed against a machine-id-derived secret — meaningful work to extract but not absolute. Phase 10 with ATECC608A or YubiKey provides hardware-bound key storage. Audit log + remote attestation (future) can detect tamper. |
| T6 (insider) | Audit log is appliance-signed — staff at cloud can't backdoor entries without appliance cooperation. Tenant isolation in DB (RBAC). Per-action approval requirements for staff cross-tenant queries. SOC2 evidence trail backs this. |
| T7 (supply chain) | OUT OF SCOPE for v2 — separate hardening story. Mitigations to ship later: cosign-signed Docker images, SBOM in every release, dependency pinning + scanning, reproducible builds. Backlog as separate epic. |

### Residual risks

These are bounded by v2 but not eliminated:

- **Cloud signing key extracted via T3 + run a long-running side channel.** Attacker can mint valid JWTs for the duration. Mitigation: short-lived JWTs (15min), rotation tooling for emergency key roll, monitoring on `/oidc/token` request anomalies. Still better than today (where bearer token is forever).
- **User loses both their passkey AND their TOTP backup AND their backup recovery code.** Bricks the account. Mitigation: at signup, require ≥2 auth methods (passkey + TOTP at minimum); show backup recovery codes during signup with "print this" CTA. Standard for any account-secure product.
- **Customer's own LAN has malware that intercepts the OIDC redirect.** SSL is the bar; we can't fully defend a compromised LAN. Mitigation: HSTS on all wattpost.cloud subdomains, encourage WAN access via broker URL when on hostile networks.

### Abuse cases worth modeling explicitly

- "Disgruntled installer with fleet:write tries to nuke a customer's site after losing the account" — destructive command requires fresh re-auth + audit log shows the trigger; cloud-side allowlist of which installers can act on which sites enforces tenancy.
- "Customer wants to revoke a stolen phone with passkeys on it" — account settings show passkey list with last-used dates + per-key revoke. Revoking a passkey invalidates all sessions ever issued with that passkey present in amr.
- "Cloud staff member tries to query a customer's database for 'support reasons'" — every cross-tenant query through the admin tool is logged in `signed_audit_log` (signed cloud-side; can be cross-checked against the customer's appliance log). Customer can export their audit history.

## Performance characteristics

| Operation | Cost | User-perceived latency |
|---|---|---|
| JWT verify (ed25519) | ~100µs | imperceptible |
| OIDC redirect first LAN login | 2 cloud round-trips (~800ms) | ~1s once per device per 90 days |
| LAN visit with valid cookie | 0 cloud round-trips | imperceptible |
| Refresh token rotation | 1 cloud round-trip | imperceptible (background) |
| WebAuthn assertion | 1 device-local (TPM/secure-enclave) op | ~500ms (passkey tap) |
| mTLS handshake (Phase 6) | 1 TLS round-trip | ~50ms first heartbeat after restart; keepalive reuses connection |
| Audit log entry sign + write | ed25519 sign ~100µs + 1 SQLite write ~1ms | imperceptible |
| Cloud-side command verify | JWT verify + DB lookup ~5ms | imperceptible |

### Storage growth

| Data | Size per appliance per year | All cloud, 1000 appliances |
|---|---|---|
| Audit log | ~30MB (worst case, busy install) | ~30GB / yr |
| OIDC refresh tokens (active) | ~1KB at any time | ~1MB |
| OIDC auth codes (60s TTL) | ~0 (cleared) | ~0 |
| Appliance keypair row | ~200 bytes once | ~200KB |
| WebAuthn credentials per user | ~500 bytes × N keys | ~500KB / 1000 users |
| Token revocation list | ~100 bytes × revocations × 24h | <10MB |

Postgres can chew through this without breaking a sweat at 10k
appliances; nothing scales superlinearly with appliance count.

### Cloud CPU load

JWT verification on every API request: ~100µs. At 10k appliances
each heartbeating every 5 min, that's ~33 requests/sec sustained,
~3ms/sec CPU. Negligible.

WebAuthn registration peaks during user onboarding only; one-shot
ops costing a few ms each.

OIDC `authorize` + `token` paths: cheap. Maybe 1-2 per user per
day at steady state once cookies settle. ~20ms each.

### Bandwidth

OIDC redirect first-visit: ~5KB across all the round-trips.
Subsequent visits: 0 cloud bandwidth. Heartbeat unchanged (~2KB).

Audit log sync: when appliances sync local audit entries to cloud
opportunistically, ~10KB/day per appliance worst case. ~10MB/day
across 1000 appliances.

No scaling concerns at our target customer counts.

## Next steps

1. Ritual North reviews this doc and pushes back on anything that smells.
2. Resolve the 8 open questions (refresh cadence, key rotation,
  KMS choice, WebAuthn RP, mTLS renewal, JWT lib, schema migration,
  breaking-change inventory).
3. Mark Phase 0 (#302) **completed**.
4. Start Phase 1 (#303) — appliance keypair foundation. ~1 week.
5. In parallel: kick off WebAuthn (#307, Phase 5) since it's cloud-
  side and doesn't block Phases 1-4.

Phase 1 lands on its own merits (per-appliance signed commands)
even if the OIDC layer isn't finished — it's a meaningful security
upgrade on its own.

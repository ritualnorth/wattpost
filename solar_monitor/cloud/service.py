"""Background heartbeat poster.

Reads the latest bank snapshot from the scheduler's `last_result`
plus today's energy aggregates from the scheduler, packages them
into a small JSON payload, and POSTs to `<endpoint>/api/heartbeat`
with the bearer token.

Failures are swallowed — losing internet must not break the local
dashboard. Each failure is logged at WARNING for diagnostics.
